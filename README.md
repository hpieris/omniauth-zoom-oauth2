# OmniAuth Zoom

An adpated and modified version of the omniauth strategy published here: https://github.com/nikhgupta/omniauth-zoom

# Source content follows

This is an OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Zoom. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth Application ID and Secret

You can read more about Zoom's OAuth over at their [developer page](https://devdocs.zoom.us/docs/oauth-with-zoom)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-zoom'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-zoom

## Usage

If omniauth-zoom is ready to go, you need to add the following lines to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
        provider :zoom, ENV['ZOOM_APP_KEY'], ENV['ZOOM_APP_SECRET']
    end

You need to replace the `ZOOM_APP_KEY` and `ZOOM_APP_SECRET` with your own credentials, you can get them at the Zoom's developer page as mention above.

Open the following URL and connect your Zoom account with your application:

    /auth/zoom
